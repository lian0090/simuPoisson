# simuPoisson
Simulate F2 populations based on Poisson distribution for the number of recombinants

## Install
If `devtools` is not installed, install devtools first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("lian0090/simuPoisson")
```

Since this is a very small program, another way is to just source the file:
https://github.com/lian0090/simuPoisson/blob/master/R/simuPoisson.R
